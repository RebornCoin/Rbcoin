Rbcoin 1.0
=============

What is Rbcoin?
--------------

Based on Bitcoin's and Zcash's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata.

This software is the Rbcoin client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of Rbcoin transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

Where do I begin?
-----------------
We have a guide for joining the main Rbcoin network:
